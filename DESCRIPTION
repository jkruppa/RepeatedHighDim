Description: RepeatedHighDim provides different functions for the construction and analysis of high-dimensional repeated measures data. Global test procedures for gene subsets from DNA microarray data or protein subsets from 2-D gel data are implemented in this package. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is implemented that can be used to generate samples from correlated binary data with given marginal distribution and correlation structure.
