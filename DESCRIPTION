Description: RepeatedHighDim provides different functions for the construction and analysis of high-dimensional repeated measures data. Global test procedures for gene subsets from DNA microarray data or protein subsets from 2-D gel data are implemented in this package. Furthermore, functions for the construction of high-dimensional count data (e.g. gene subsets from RNA-seq) or correlated binary data are given.
