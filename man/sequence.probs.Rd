\usage{
sequence.probs(X1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{Representative matrix generated by the genetic algorithm
with \code{\link{iter.matrix}}}
}
\value{
A vector of probabilities for the binary sequences
}
\description{
Calculation of proabilities for binary sequences based on the
final matrix generated by the genetic algorithm
}
\details{
Observation of binary correlated binary data can be expressed as
binary sequences. In the case of two binary variables possible
observations are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). In general, 2^m
binary sequences are possible, where m is the number of binary
variables. Based on the representative matrix generated by the
genetic algorithm the probability for each binary sequence is
determined.

\examples{
### A simple example
X0 = start.matrix(n = 100, p = c(0.5, 0.6))
X = iter.matrix(X0, V = diag(2))
sequence.probs(X)
